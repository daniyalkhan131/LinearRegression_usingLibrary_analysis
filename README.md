# LinearRegression_usingLibrary_analysis
Random dataset taken and divide it into ten equal parts say p1,....,p10. Take 10% of data from each part and prepare test data. Take the remaining 90% of data from p1 and make a liner regression model (say M1). Take the remaining 90% data from p1 and p2 and make another linear regression model (say M2). Proceed in the same way. Find MSE for each.



Consider the dataset randomly and
divide it into ten equal parts say p1, p2....p10. Take 10% of data from each part
and prepare test data. Take the remaining 90% of data from p1 and make a
liner regression model (say M1). Take the remaining 90% data from p1 and p2
and make another linear regression model (say M2). Proceed in the same way
i.e model Mk will use the remaining 90% of data from upto pk part. Build ten
linear regression models. Find MSE (Mean square error) corresponding to
each model then plot the curve by taking models on x-axis and corresponding
MSE on y-axis.
