# LinearRegression_usingLibrary_analysis
Random dataset taken and divide it into ten equal parts say p1,....,p10. Take 10% of data from each part and prepare test data. Take the remaining 90% of data from p1 and make a liner regression model (say M1). Take the remaining 90% data from p1 and p2 and make another linear regression model (say M2). Proceed in the same way. Find MSE for each.
